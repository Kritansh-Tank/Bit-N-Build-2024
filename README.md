🌍 EcoTravel: Global Eco-Friendly Travel Planner
Bit N Build 2024 Hackathon Project

🚀 Project Overview
EcoTravel is an innovative web-based platform designed to help users plan sustainable travel experiences while minimizing their environmental impact. Tourism significantly contributes to climate change, and EcoTravel offers eco-conscious travelers the tools they need to make greener travel choices without compromising convenience or experience.

💡 Problem Statement
Tourism's reliance on flights, cruise ships, and other carbon-heavy travel modes is a major contributor to climate change. As awareness of environmental impact grows, there’s an increasing demand for sustainable travel options. However, there’s no comprehensive platform to help travelers plan eco-friendly trips, balancing environmental responsibility with travel enjoyment. EcoTravel bridges that gap, providing tools to calculate carbon footprints, offer greener alternatives, and connect with eco-conscious accommodations and activities.

Google Maps Directions API (SerpApi)
